# Loop example - increment 4 memory locations
beqz-pred $4 $7   # Position 0: Check counter at position 4, jump to exit at 7 if 0
succ &5           # Position 1: Increment value at address pointed by register 5
succ $5           # Position 2: Move pointer to next location
beqz-pred $6 $0   # Position 3: Jump back to start (position 6 is always 0)
4                 # Position 4: Counter (loop 4 times)
8                 # Position 5: Pointer to first data location
0                 # Position 6: Always 0 (used for unconditional jump)
exit              # Position 7: Exit instruction
0                 # Position 8: Data location 1
0                 # Position 9: Data location 2
